## üöÄ Overview  

In a dynamic and highly competitive market, **accurate demand forecasting** is the key to resource optimization and cost control.  
This repository presents a real-world case study applying **machine learning** to predict **client demand**, using **production and material consumption data** from K Company‚Äôs Xinfeng plant (2024.01‚Äì2024.06).  

We combine **Random Forest Regression (RF)** with advanced techniques in:  

- üìà Feature Engineering  
- üîç SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability  
- üß† Neural Network Baseline Comparisons

## üîç SHAP Analysis & Key Insights  

To enhance model interpretability, we used **SHAP** to identify the most critical features affecting demand predictions.  

### **SHAP Summary Plot**  
The following SHAP plot shows the top factors influencing client demand:

- **Product-related features** had the strongest impact.  
- **Product-material interactions** played a crucial role.  
- **Client-product relationships** showed significant variation in demand patterns.  

### **SHAP Decision Impact**  
SHAP values help reveal the influence of each feature on individual predictions:

üìä **Findings:**  
- Some products exhibit **high SHAP values**, indicating strong demand predictability.  
- Others with **low SHAP values** may require strategic adjustments in production or supply chain.
