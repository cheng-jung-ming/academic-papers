## üöÄ Overview  

In a dynamic and highly competitive market, **accurate demand forecasting** is the key to resource optimization and cost control.  
This repository presents a real-world case study applying **machine learning** to predict **client demand**, using **production and material consumption data** from K Company‚Äôs Xinfeng plant (2024.01‚Äì2024.06).  

We combine **Random Forest Regression (RF)** with advanced techniques in:  

- üìà Feature Engineering  
- üîç SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability  
- üß† Neural Network Baseline Comparisons

## üîç SHAP Analysis & Key Insights  

To enhance model interpretability, we used **SHAP** to identify the most critical features affecting demand predictions.  

### **SHAP Summary Plot**  
The following SHAP plot shows the top factors influencing client demand:  

![SHAP Summary Plot](images/SHAPÂÄºÂúñÁ§∫.png)  

- **Product-related features** had the strongest impact.  
- **Product-material interactions** played a crucial role.  
- **Client-product relationships** showed significant variation in demand patterns.  

### **SHAP Feature Dependence**  
The SHAP feature dependence plot visualizes how the values of each feature influence the model‚Äôs prediction. It reveals the trends and relationships between feature values and their corresponding SHAP values, highlighting the strength and direction of each feature's impact on the model's predictions.

üìä **Findings:**  
- Some products exhibit **high SHAP values**, indicating strong demand predictability.  
- Others with **low SHAP values** may require strategic adjustments in production or supply chain.
